# Tukoffee

Tukoffee is a mobile app for a coffee shop. Users can add/remove products to cart and create/cancel orders.  Through the Paystack SDK, users can checkout their orders using credit card or any of the available payment gateways. Users can also manage their profile, and track their order as well.
Customers may write product reviews provided the product was orderd from the app and received by the customers.
The app also has a feedback form where users can send their feedback or ask for help.


The app also offers a minimal admin dashboard for the owner or stuff to: manage customers, update order status, add/edit products, review product reviews, and a quick link to Paystack Dashboard.
